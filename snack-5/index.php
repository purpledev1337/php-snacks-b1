I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.

            He taught me a code. To survive. Watching ice melt. This is fun. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. Cops, another community I'm not part of.
            
            Only you could make those words cute. He taught me a code. To survive. Like a sloth. I can do that. I'm doing mental jumping jacks. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.";
